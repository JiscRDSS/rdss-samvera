# The form only specifies the drop down for the licenceIdentifier, so there is a translation table in the locales
# section that keys of a normalised version of the url. That is a version with all non-alphanumeric characters replaced
# by underscores. There is an edge case where two of those could collide, but this is very unlikely, since none of the
# licences use '_' as a separator between characters.
