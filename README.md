# Willow

[ ![Codeship Status for CottageLabs/willow](https://app.codeship.com/projects/7ccf4810-f82c-0134-d891-3ee9bddbeb77/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/210883)

## Introduction

[willow](https://github.com/CottageLabs/willow) is an implementation of the Fedora/Hydra stack by [Cottage Labs](http://cottagelabs.com/). It is built with Docker containers, which simplify development and deployment onto live services.


## Getting Started

1. Install Docker [by following step 1 of the Docker Compose installation tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your machine.

2. Make sure you don't need to `sudo` to run docker. [Instructions on set-up and how to test that it works.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/#/manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)

3. Install [Docker Compose by following steps 2 and onwards from the Docker Compose installation Tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

> Ubuntu Linux users, the command that Docker-Compose provides you with will not work since /usr/local/bin is not writeable by anybody but root in default Ubuntu setups. Use `sudo tee` instead, e.g.:
  
```bash
$ curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/[INSERT_DESIRED_DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION_HERE]/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/docker-compose > /dev/null && sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

4. Open a console and try running `docker -h` and `docker-compose -h` to verify they are both accessible.

5. Clone this repository to a suitable place:
```bash
$ cd /some/working/directory
$ git clone https://github.com/CottageLabs/willow.git
$ cd willow
```

6. Initiate the Geoblacklight and willow_sword submodules

```bash
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

7. Create three environmental variable files: `.env`, `.env.production` and `.env.development`,  to set the postgres database username and password and also other keys. You can use the `example.env`, `example.env.production` and `example.env.development` files as templates:

__example .env file__
```bash
# POSTGRES_HOST=hostname, defaults to "db" used by docker-compose
# POSTGRES_PORT=5432 by default
# FEDORA_URL_SCHEME, FEDORA_HOST and FEDORA_PORT can be set. Default values are provided if not set.
# SOLR_URL_SCHEME, SOLR_HOST and SOLR_PORT can be set. Default values are provided if not set.
# REDIS_HOST and REDIS_PORT can be set. Default values are provided if not set.
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password

# this should be a very long random key. You can use "$ bundle exec rake secret" to generate one.
SECRET_KEY_BASE_TEST=fb350a4ff22efffba83ff0d73e6a73b0bbca9cdb22683c61e49d8f57280a3988e8c79323c48382a0c565b3db1d7f8bf0924d27542c3322db898948f50530879e

# Serve Geoblacklight on port 81 (default is 3010)

```

__example .env.production file__
```bash
# You will probably need to set POSTGRES_HOST and possibly POSTGRES_PORT in production (see example.env above).

# this should be a very long random key. You can use "$ bundle exec rake secret" to generate one.

```

8. Run `docker-compose up` to download, build and initialise the infrastructure

The system can be built and run in either *development* mode (allowing changes on the fly) or in *production* mode (where code and assets are pre-built and cannot be changed on startup).
 
To enable development mode, you should symlink the file `docker-compose.development.yml` to `docker-compose.override.yml`.
Conversely, to enable production mode, simply delete the `docker-compose.override.yml` file if it exists.

__enabling development mode__
```bash
$ ln -sf docker-compose.development.yml docker-compose.override.yml
```

__enabling production mode__
```bash
$ rm -f docker-compose.override.yml
```

To build and run the system, issue the `up` command to docker-compose: 
```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```

Note that once the system has been built, the image will be cached. You can force a rebuild with `docker-compose up --build`.


And to start from a blank slate by completely wiping the system and data, run `docker-compose down --volumes` first:
```bash
$ docker-compose down --volumes && docker-compose up --build 
```


9. If everything is successful, after a few minutes you should be able to see Willow running.
  - Willow:
    - Mac: http://192.168.99.100:3000 (or possibly port 80 depending on your `env` files)
    - Linux: http://localhost:3000

10. To get a bash prompt within the Willow container (e.g. to run rake tasks), you can run:
```bash
$ docker-compose run --rm willow bash
```

11. To get a rails console within the Willow container for debugging, you can run:
```bash
$ docker-compose run --rm willow rails console
```

12. To run the full Willow test suite, use:
```bash
$ docker-compose run --rm -e RAILS_ENV=test willow rake spec
```

13. JISC RDSS message schemas tests
  
  There are some tests defined which require 3rd party Json schemas defined in a private repository: https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-message-api-docs/
  If you have access to this private repository, do the following steps: 

  - Ensure the path "/willow/spec/fixtures/files/schemas/jisc_rdss/*" is in your `.gitignore` file.

  - Then, copy the following files and folders to the given locations:
    -  https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-message-api-docs/tree/master/messages  => willow/willow/spec/fixtures/files/schemas/jisc_rdss/messages
    -  https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-message-api-docs/tree/master/schemas   => willow/willow/spec/fixtures/files/schemas/jisc_rdss/schemas

  - Be sure that the files above are not committed to git!
